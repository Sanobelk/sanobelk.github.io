# Quick Definition Lookup

Using the free API from [Free Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.dev/), I've created a simple and effective definition lookup app.

## Why?

There are a few things that annoyed me when using online dictionaries.

1. They provide a plethora of information. While synonyms, pronounciation and examples are appreciated, usually all I need is a simple definition. I'm not an English major. I'm a simple man with simple needs.
1. If I lookup another search result, I'm pushed onto another page. I don't like being tossed around.
1. If I want to see a previous search result, I either have to navigate through my browser history manually or hit the back button until I find what I'm looking for. I'm very lazy.

And because I'm lazy in that regard, I've created this app to solve my three issues. This is by no means a replacement for any dictionary website. It's just meant to make my life (and hopefully yours) easier when searching for word definitions and nothing more.

**This was also my first time using an API. Yay.**
