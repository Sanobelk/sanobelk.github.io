        <p><strong>Tania Eshaghoff Friedberg</strong>, pianist, composer was born in Tehran, Iran in 1974. She started studying piano at the age of seven with Mahdogh Monesabian (formerly Tehran Conservatory of Music) who introduced her to an improvisatory style of Persian folk melodies. These romantic melodies were the inspiration for Tania’s continued musical career and growth as a Persian woman playing music in spite of social barriers. Since 1996, Tania has been under the musical wing of Dr Edward Smaldone, Director of Copland School of Music, Queens College, CUNY. ”Her new album ‘A Road to Tehran’ is a synthesis of Persian and western styles.<p>
        <p>The most significant influences in both style and substance of Tania’s music stems from the Persian tradition of the Santur (dulcimer) with its elaborate rhythmic and melodic figuration, here translated into a distinct pianistic technique. Tania has performed numerous concerts on such prestigious stages as the Weill Recital Hall at Carnegie Hall, Symphony Space, The Museum of American Piano, Le Frak Concert Hall, Center of Jewish History and the Makor Center of the 92nd Street.</p>
        <p>Her private audiences include diplomats, ambassadors and Her Majesty Farah Pahlavi of Iran. Her first Debut Album “A Road To Tehran” is the musical travels that extend from Tehran to the west and then back maintaining the distinct flavor of those two distinct parts of the world. It is the physical travels between the world of Iran and the modern west. This current project is a fond look back to that time and place that acknowledges a modern sensibility.</p>
