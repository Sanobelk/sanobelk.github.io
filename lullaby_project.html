    <p>"This body of work, THE LULLABY PROJECT I hope will allow ones mind to wander to a beautiful place- never ever realizing that the music disguises the lullaby and nursery rhymes we all have kept in our consciousness. The pieces are arranged so that one never really senses the length of time. I hope It takes you to a peaceful, inspiring, dreamy, romantic and endearing place. The sounds will create a place to go in ones mind of love, comfort, familiarity and to a place we all keep as Home" <br>-TANIA</p>
    
    <p>The Lullaby Project created by Iranian born Artist, Composer, Pianist and now proud mother, TANIA. This Project took her over four years to create. What drives her music is the innate need to express her identity with influences of Persian Culture. Having to leave Iran during the revolutionary war of 1980 she experienced a disconnect between who she wants to become (American- Free) and who she is suppose to be (Iranian woman- Duty and Obligations). It is her hope that this Project will begin dialogue among the very young who have a Persian background- and also introduce this style to the non native. The arrangement was done purposefully so that it is approachable to the very young and written in a landscape and technique that is adaptable for them to understand. She fears that the Persian Traditions and language in America is dying. The hope is that hearing elements and certain styles of Persian Instrumental Folk Tunes will create an interest in the young to discover the music on their own. The goal is to keep our identity in the every powerful melting pot of America.</p>
    
    <p>It started with Twinkle Twinkle and Fre Jaque to lull her babies to sleep and grew into an abundant collection of adaptations. It is romantic, sentimental, touching and at times provocative. This body of work takes the listener,child and adult from Europe, Italy, France, Germany to the Middle East of Iran.

    <p>Twinkle Twinkle has it Mozart’s adaptations with Hatikvah- National Anthem of Israel which lends itself to Louie Armstrong’s What a Wonderful World- (most people do not know that all of those songs came from Mozart’s Twinkle Twinkle but in various keys.)
    Fre Jaque grew from a beautiful French Melody used in so many nursery rhymes to a layered, provocatively sensual adaptation of Leonard Cohen’s Hallelujah- sung by Soprano, Leah Moss Tehrani.
    Rashid-Khan is a famous Persian Iranian Folk Tune from Mashad, IRAN, with the beautiful tones of the Santur played by Arieh Aghajani.</p>


    <p>This elaborate collection and work was made with the adult in mind who shares the space and time of putting the children to sleep. She still plays these songs at night for her children. The romantic and full sound of the cello played by amazingly skilled cellist, Christopher Hoffman – carries the melody and sets the tone for the style of TANIA’s music. In relation to her last project, A ROAD TO TEHRAN, which has it a more symphonic sound, THE LULLABY PROJECT has a more intimate dialogue between the piano, cello and santur and in Halleluyah, the human voice. Each carrying the music and layering it in depth.

    <p>“Like all great Artists, TANIA creates a style of music only she can do” Smaldone, Director of Copeland School of Music. City University of New York. </p>
